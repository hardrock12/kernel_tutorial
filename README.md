kernel_tutorial
===============

A kernel dev project for a dummy like me.


TODO
====

1. Test gnu-binutils's ld validity.
2. Test nasm validity.
3. Adapt update_image.sh script to mac os x (using `hdiutil mount floppy.img -mountpoint mnt`).
4. Adapt run_bochs.sh script to mac os x (converting `losetup` tool to mac os x. I don't know -yet- how...)
